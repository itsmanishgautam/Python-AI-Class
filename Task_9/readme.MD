# Bot for Finding Path in a Matrix

This bot is designed to find a path from a starting number to a destination number in a given matrix. It uses a greedy algorithm to select the bot's starting position and then attempts to find the shortest path to the destination number.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Run the bot script:

   ```
   python bot.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input a number and observe the path found by the bot.

## Functionality

- The bot generates a random matrix with dimensions based on the input number.
- It selects a starting number from the outer layer of the matrix and a destination number from within the matrix.
- It then attempts to find a path from the starting number to the destination number.
- If a path is found, it prints the path. Otherwise, it indicates that no path was found.
