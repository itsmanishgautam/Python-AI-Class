# Learning Reinforcement

## Concept Overview

Learning Reinforcement is a process where initial mistakes are allowed during the learning phase to train entities not to repeat them. However, once learning transitions to reinforcement, strict adherence to established rules is mandatory unless critical tasks occur. It's an ongoing process to teach entities to follow rules and reward them based on their performance. The aim is to train entities to execute tasks effectively.

## Key Principles

1. **Mistake Tolerance During Learning**: Mistakes are part of the learning process and are acceptable during the initial stages but rules are to be followed at all times.
   
2. **Strict Rule Commitment During Reinforcement**: Once in the reinforcement phase, rules must be followed.

3. **Pre-broadcasted Rules**: The rules must be communicated to all relevant parties who can influence the entity's path to achievement.

## Process

### Objective Achievement

An entity (individual, organization, thread, etc.) aims to achieve certain objectives by following established rules and regulations. During this journey, the entity may face obstacles or may proceed without interference.

### Handling Obstacles

When an obstacle is encountered, there are two possible responses:
1. **Enforce Rules on the Obstacle**: 
   - Make the obstructing entity aware of the rules.
   - Encourage them to change their direction by understanding and adhering to the rules.
2. **Change Own Direction**:
   - The entity may change its own direction only under critical conditions where reinforcing the rules on the obstruction is not viable.

## Solution
To prevent obstacles, the best approach is to perform tasks simultaneously rather than concurrently. This method decreases the chance of bottlenecks and interruptions, thereby lowering costs. Pre-communicating rules ensures all parties are informed and accountable, creating a proactive environment that aims to prevent disruptions and maintain smooth operations.

## Examples

### Example 1: Balen Shah, Mayor of Kathmandu, Nepal
Balen Shah enforces rules on those who obstruct progress. He educates the obstructing parties about the rules and regulations, helping them understand why their actions are obstructive and encouraging compliance.

### Example 2: Trainee
Trainee implementing the concepts of learning reinforcement to gain knowledge during learning hour and implementing them practically in project or work environments.



### RAW
Learning Reinforcement can be implemented as:

mistake can only be allowed while learning, while reinforcing it must follow the rules.

the rules have to be pre broadcasted to concerns party who can later impact on entity path to achievement. 

Suppose an entity is on its way to achieve its certain objectives following rules and regulations. On its way to achieve it, it may came accorss to certain obstructions or can achieve its task without interference. 

Now, in case of obstruction, there can be two cases, either enforce rules on the obstruction and make them change their direction by making them realize their rules or change self direction.

Only cases for changing direction will be by self reinforcing to break rules will be only when obstruction is on criticl conditions. 

Ex: balen shah , mayor of kathmandu,nepal. he is enforcing rules to those who are obstructing, whoever block the path, obstruct, he is trying to bring them rules and make them realize that abstruction is wrong by making them re learn or re evaluate reules and regulations.
