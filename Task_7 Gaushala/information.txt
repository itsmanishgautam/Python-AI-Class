Kathmandu, May 19

The Kathmandu Metropolitan City Office has initiated the demolition of houses and shops built by encroaching on the
roadside in Gaushala Chowk. Four bulldozers were employed to remove the unauthorized structures, causing some disruption
to traffic in the area.

This action is part of a broader campaign led by Mayor Balen Shah to reclaim public property and eliminate illegal
constructions. According to Rajunath Pandey, the Chief of Kathmandu Metropolitan City Police, the demolition process
began with six houses on the first day. Despite a 35-day notice and a 15-day period of public announcements urging
property owners to dismantle their structures voluntarily, the city had to proceed with the demolitions after the owners
failed to comply.

Pandey highlighted that the issue of roadside encroachment dates back to 2035, with many buildings constructed within
the road boundary collecting rent unlawfully. The current operation aims to remove 32 additional temporary structures,
including towers and shutters, to ensure the road is clear and in compliance with urban planning regulations.
