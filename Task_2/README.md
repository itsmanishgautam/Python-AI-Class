**Generate a Course at Random First**:
   This step involves generating a course randomly. Without more context, it's unclear what kind of course you're referring to. However, you would need to generate some data representing a course, which could include fields like course name, course code, instructor, etc.

**Generate faker, merge faker and course, and split to three output**:
   This step involves using Faker library to generate fake data, merging it with the course data generated in the first step, and then splitting the merged data into three output files. The specifics of how to merge and split the data depend on the structure of your data and your requirements.

**Run NRB scrap and generate forex.csv**:
   This step involves scraping data from NRB (presumably Nepal Rastra Bank) and generating a file named `forex.csv`. This file likely contains foreign exchange rate data.

**Generate: Data exported to csv/Country_and_CurrencyCode.csv**:
   This step involves generating a file named `Country_and_CurrencyCode.csv`. The contents of this file are not specified, but it likely contains data relating to countries and currency codes.

**Merge Forex_Country_Merged.py**:
   This step involves running a Python script (`Forex_Country_Merged.py`) to merge `forex.csv` and `Country_and_CurrencyCode.csv` based on currency codes. The output of this merge is saved to a file named `CountryAdd_onCurrency_output.csv`.

**Merge all.py**:
   This step involves running another Python script (`all.py`) to perform multiple operations:
   - Reorder the columns in the data to bring the "Country" column first.
   - Convert the data to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
   - Merge the reordered and lowercased data with other datasets.
   - Export the final merged data.
